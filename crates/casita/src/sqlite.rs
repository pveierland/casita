//! The shared Turso connection layer behind persistent repository state.
//!
//! Turso operates directly on the repository's SQLite-format database.
//! [`TursoMetadataStore`](crate::TursoMetadataStore) speaks SQL through [`TursoDb`]
//! and shares pooled connections across snapshots.
//!
//! The SQL above this module deliberately stays in the conservative SQLite
//! subset: plain tables, `INSERT OR REPLACE`, parameterized reads/deletes,
//! bytewise `BLOB` keys, and binary-collated `TEXT`. The on-disk contract is
//! `<repository>/casita.sqlite`.
//!
//! Turso's experimental multi-process WAL is enabled when the database is
//! built, on every supported platform. MVCC is intentionally not enabled:
//! casita serializes writes on one connection in-process, while the WAL
//! coordinates separate processes and keeps readers moving during a write.
//!
//! Database transactions protect logical state; durable repository pins retain
//! data used by mutations and stable reads during physical collection.
